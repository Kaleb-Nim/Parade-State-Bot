  below:
  <analysis>
  Let me analyze the conversation chronologically to ensure I capture all important details:

  1. Initial Request:
     - User asked for a technical plan to implement a Parade State Bot
     - I created a plan with directory structure and data flow diagram

  2. Implementation of Phase 1:
     - Created project structure following the plan
     - Implemented configuration management with settings.py
     - Created Pydantic models for staff members, duty instructors, and parade state
     - Implemented Google Sheets service for fetching data

     - Added Docker support

  3. Model Enhancement:
     - User provided example.txt with additional parade states
     - Enhanced models to handle complex status formats
     - Added more status types and location details

  4. Hidden Rows Handling:
     - User explained that Google Sheet has hidden rows for inactive staff
     - Implemented a hardcoded list of active row numbers in config.py
     - Modified Google Sheets service to only process active rows

  5. Pandas Implementation:
     - User requested optimization using pandas

     - Improved data handling and status parsing
     - Initially supported both implementations with a flag

  6. Code Cleanup:
     - User requested cleanup to use only the pandas implementation
     - Removed the old implementation and consolidated into a single service
     - Updated references and documentation
     - Simplified the code base

  7. Commit Message:
     - User requested a commit message summarizing all the changes
     - I provided a title and detailed description of the implementation

  Key technical details:
  - Project follows a clean architecture with models, services, and utilities
  - Pydantic models for data validation and representation
  - pandas for efficient spreadsheet processing
  - Command-line interface with argparse
  - Logging system with loguru
  - Docker support for deployment
  - Various status types and formats (P, CSE, OL, AM/PM splits, etc.)
  - Special handling for location details and end dates
  - Date-based column selection

  Most recent work before summary request:
  - Writing a commit message summarizing all the changes
  - No pending tasks were explicitly mentioned after this

  The conversation shows a complete implementation of the Parade State Bot from planning to final cleanup, with all 
  requested features implemented.
  </analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user requested the development of a Parade State Bot to automate sending daily attendance reports for 24 permanent 
  staff members. The bot needed to fetch data from Google Sheets, generate a structured message with staff status 
  information, and send it via Telegram. Specific requirements included handling various status types, AM/PM splits, 
  formatting dates, and solving the issue of hidden rows in the spreadsheet. Later, they requested optimization using pandas
   and code cleanup to simplify the implementation.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Python application architecture (models, services, utilities)
     - Pydantic models for data validation and representation
     - Google Sheets API integration for fetching attendance data
     - Telegram Bot API for message delivery
     - pandas for efficient spreadsheet data processing
     - Status parsing and formatting (P, CSE, OL, WFH, AM/PM splits, etc.)
     - Location detail parsing (using @ symbol)
     - Date handling and column selection
     - Configuration management
     - Docker containerization
     - Command-line interface with argparse
     - Logging with loguru

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `app/config.py`:
       - Contains configuration settings including the crucial `active_staff_rows` list
       - Handles environment variables and default settings
       - Important for managing the hardcoded list of row numbers for active staff

     - `app/models/staff.py`:
       - Defines `StatusType` enum with all possible attendance statuses
       - Implements `StaffMember`, `StaffStatus`, and `LocationDetail` Pydantic models
       - Handles complex status formatting including AM/PM splits and locations
       ```python
       class StatusType(str, Enum):
           """Enumeration of possible staff status types."""
           PRESENT = "P"  # Present
           CSE = "CSE"  # Course
           # ... other status types
       ```

     - `app/services/google_sheets.py`:
       - Consolidated implementation using pandas for data handling
       - Handles fetching data from Google Sheets API
       - Implements column finding for specific dates
       - Processes only active staff rows based on configuration
       - Parses complex status strings including locations and end dates
       ```python
       def find_date_columns(self, df: pd.DataFrame, target_date: date) -> Tuple[int, int]:
           """Find the AM and PM column indices for a specific date."""
           # Finds date columns in spreadsheet headers
       ```

     - `app/services/telegram.py`:
       - Implements Telegram Bot API integration
       - Handles sending formatted messages to the configured chat
       - Fetches DI (Duty Instructor) information from chat history

     - `app/services/message_builder.py`:
       - Coordinates between Google Sheets and Telegram services
       - Builds parade state reports with all required components
       - Formats the final message for sending

     - `app/main.py`:
       - Application entry point with command-line parsing
       - Implements main functionality for sending/drafting parade states
       - Handles date parsing and error handling

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Hidden Rows: Solved by implementing a hardcoded list of active row numbers to process only visible staff members
     - Complex Status Parsing: Implemented robust parsing for various status formats, locations, and AM/PM splits
     - Date-based Column Selection: Created a function to find the right columns for a specific date in the spreadsheet
     - Optimized Data Processing: Replaced the original implementation with a pandas-based version for better performance
     - Code Duplication: Consolidated multiple implementations into a single, clean service

  5. Pending Tasks:
     No explicit pending tasks were mentioned after completing the code cleanup and providing the commit message.

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work was creating a commit message to summarize all the code implementations from start to finish. The 
  message included a title "Implement Parade State Bot with pandas-based Google Sheets processing" and a detailed 
  description covering the core implementation, data handling features, active staff management, and other features. This 
  was in response to the user's direct request to "Write commit message detailing all code implementations from the start to
   current change."

  7. Optional Next Step:
     The conversation reached a natural conclusion with the commit message creation, and no further explicit tasks were 
  mentioned. The parade state bot implementation is complete with all requested features. If further work is needed, it 
  would be appropriate to wait for the user to specify the next steps, which could include testing the implementation, 
  adding new features, or integrating with additional services.
